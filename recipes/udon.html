        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Kake Udon (かけうどん) is the most basic form of hot udon noodle soup, made of udon noodles sitting in a flavorful dashi based broth. In my opinion, it is most inspiring as it is exactly the kind of food that celebrates simplicity.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Broth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cups <strong>dashi</strong>(use standard Awase Dashi, a dashi packet or powder, or Vegan Dashi)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp <strong>mirin</strong></li>
            <li>1 tsp <strong>sugar</strong></li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp <strong>soy sauce</strong></li>
            <li>1/8 - 1/4 tsp  <strong>Diamond Crystal kosher salt</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Noodles and Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 servings <strong>udon noodles</strong></li>
            <li>1 <strong>green onion/scallion</strong>Sliced onions give sweetness to the dish and are a perfect pair with tender beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Seven Spice</strong>(optional)</li>
           
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, add 2⅓ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp sugar, 1½ Tbsp soy sauce, and ⅛–¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Bring the broth to a gentle simmer. Once the broth is simmering, remove it from the heat. Cover with a lid and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water comes to a full rolling boil, add 2 servings udon noodles and cook according to the package instructions. For fresh homemade udon, separate and untangle the strands of noodles with your hands, and cook for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using chopsticks, stir the noodles so they don‘t stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>When the noodles are done cooking, drain them in a colander and cool under cold running water.</li>
            <li>Once the noodles are cool enough to touch, use your hands to rinse them well under the cold running water to remove the starch and give the noodles a firm texture. Then, switch to hot running water to warm up the noodles; alternatively, you can heat them up in a pot of hot water.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot udon noodles in individual bowls. Pour the hot broth over the noodles and top with 1 green onion/scallion (chopped) and shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) for a spicy kick (optional). For a more substantial lunch or dinner, you can top it with tempura, beef, fish cake and toasted mochi, tofu, Inari age, or vegetables.</li>
        </ol>
